## üéì RETROSPECTIVE

### What Went Well ‚≠ê

1. **TDD Workflow:**
   - Writing tests first caught bugs early
   - 98% coverage achieved naturally through TDD
   - Red-green-refactor cycle worked perfectly

2. **GitHub Issue Tracking:**
   - Using issues for tasks (T-XXX) and bugs (B-XXX) kept work organized
   - Auto-closing issues with "Closes #X" streamlined workflow
   - Clear separation between features and bugs

3. **Documentation:**
   - Writing docs during BUILD phase (not after) kept them current
   - README.md comprehensive and helpful
   - CONTRIBUTING.md attracted potential contributors

4. **SPEC Phase Investment:**
   - Time spent in planning paid off during BUILD
   - No scope creep or requirement changes
   - Clear acceptance criteria made validation easy

5. **Bug Handling Protocol:**
   - B-006 caught and fixed properly
   - Human verification required for bugs prevented premature closure
   - "Addresses #B-XXX" (not "Closes") worked well

### What Could Be Improved üîß

1. **Validation Phase:**
   - Should have created VALIDATION_REPORT.md during BUILD, not at epoch end
   - Manual testing could have been more systematic
   - Performance testing could be more rigorous

2. **Acceptance Testing:**
   - As solo developer, acceptance testing felt redundant with validation
   - Need better process for personal projects (still valuable for discipline)

3. **Migration Testing:**
   - Could test migrations on multiple database backends
   - Didn't test migration rollback scenarios

4. **Documentation:**
   - Could add more code examples in README
   - Could include architecture diagrams
   - API documentation could show more curl examples

5. **Continuous Integration:**
   - No CI/CD pipeline set up
   - Tests only run locally
   - Could automate deployment

### Lessons Learned üí°

1. **CSRF Protection:**
   - Django template tags (`{{ csrf_token }}`) more reliable than cookie parsing
   - CSRF issues common in AJAX-heavy Django apps
   - Always test in real browser, not just curl

2. **AI-Native Development:**
   - Following strict phases (SPEC ‚Üí BUILD ‚Üí VALIDATION ‚Üí ACCEPTANCE TEST ‚Üí SHIP) prevents mistakes
   - TodoWrite tool essential for tracking progress
   - Client approval gates prevent building wrong things

3. **Test Coverage:**
   - 98% coverage is achievable with TDD
   - Some untested code is acceptable (admin display methods, serializer edge cases)
   - 100% coverage not always worth the effort

4. **Documentation Timing:**
   - README should be written DURING BUILD, not after
   - Easier to document while code is fresh in mind
   - Prevents "what does this do again?" moments

5. **Personal Projects:**
   - Still valuable to follow full process even when self is client
   - Forces you to think critically about requirements
   - Creates portfolio-quality work

### Action Items for Next Epoch üìù

1. **Process Improvements:**
   - Create VALIDATION_REPORT template at start of BUILD
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
   - Add automated code quality checks (flake8, mypy)

2. **Technical Debt:**
   - Add database backend testing (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
   - Improve serializer test coverage
   - Add performance benchmarks

3. **Features for v2.0.0:**
   - Multiplayer mode (two players)
   - AI opponent
   - User authentication
   - Game history/replay
   - Leaderboard/statistics

4. **Documentation:**
   - Add architecture diagrams
   - Create video walkthrough
   - Add more API examples
   - Create quickstart guide

5. **Community:**
   - Publish to PyPI
   - Create demo site
   - Write blog post
   - Submit to Django packages
